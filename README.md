# ESP32-IoT-Project-with-Blynk-and-MQTT
This project implements an IoT system using an ESP32 microcontroller, which connects to WiFi, reads data from multiple sensors (DHT22, ADXL345, LM35), and sends the data to Blynk and an MQTT broker. Additionally, it provides remote control of an LED via Blynk.
